Key/Mouse inputs:
    
    The only key inputs for my game (besides 
    cheats are the arrow keys, which all are used, but
    each have boundaries.  For the left, right, and down
    arrow keys the boundary is the wall, and for the up 
    arrow key the boundary is 50 pixels above the bottom.

Cheat keys:

    Given:
        L: gives an additional life
        R: resets the ball and paddle to original position
        0-9: switches the the appropriate (or highest
            available) level

    Personal:
        D/A: speeds up and slows down the ball (respectively)
        W/A: speeds up and slows down the paddle (respectively)
        B: clears all the blocks on the level
        P: drops a random powerup from the top center 
            of the screen

### Impressions

    I loved this project.  The entire time coding time 
    flew by.  I worked hard to rid my code of smells,
    however i was unable to not use any getters and setters, and I used a few switch statements because I was
    unsure how to write the program without them (and why they
    are a smell).  I don't think i have much to any repitition
    in my project (and I'm sure you all will point it out to me
    if there is some), which I was very proud of and made
    implementing further changes (once I finished something
    but then had another object interact with it) very easy.
